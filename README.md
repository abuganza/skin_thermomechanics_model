# Skin thermo-mechanics modeling

Theoretical models of skin thermo-mechanical response to superphysiological temperatures. 

As a starting point, the native skin behavior is modeled with a microstructure-based strain energy function accounting for fiber orientation and waviness distribution. 

A first approach to model denaturation is a two-state model in which the waviness distribution is shifted to reflect coiling of collagen and reduction of the stress-free length. Aditionally, the denatured collagen is modeled viscoelastic. 

The second model of denaturation is a three-state model in which a first reaction captures the coiling (reduction in stress-free length) of collagen through the shift in the waviness distribution. A second reaction then captures damage or compromised capacity to carry strain energy.
